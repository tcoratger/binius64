/// MLE-check round evaluator for one quadratic composition over N store columns.

/// This is the store-backed successor of the quadratic MLE-check prover: it evaluates the
/// composition in one pass per round, using the Gruen32-style degree-2 interpolation trick. Batch
/// several quadratic MLE checks by registering one evaluator per claim on a shared store; they read
/// the shared columns from the same round pass.
///
/// The evaluator emits the prime (eq-factored) round polynomial of the MLE-check protocol. Wrap it
/// in [`MleToSumCheckEvaluator`](super::MleToSumCheckEvaluator) to emit a regular sumcheck round
/// polynomial.

	/// * `infinity_composition` - The composition restricted to its highest-degree terms, for the
	///   Karatsuba evaluation at infinity.
	/// * `eval_claim` - The claimed evaluation of the composition's MLE at the point.
