/// Channel for IOP provers that extends the IP prover channel with oracle operations.
///
/// In an IOP, the prover can:
/// 1. Send field elements to the verifier via `send_*` methods (inherited)
/// 2. Sample random challenges via `sample` (inherited)
/// 3. Commit oracles to the verifier
/// 4. Respond to oracle queries with opening proofs
///
/// # Contract
///
/// The caller must call `send_oracle()` exactly `remaining_oracle_specs().len()` times before
/// calling `prove_oracle_relations()`. Each oracle buffer must match the corresponding
/// specification.

	/// the message here so the channel does not need to store it internally.
	///
	/// # Preconditions
	///
	/// * `remaining_oracle_specs()` must be empty (all oracles committed).
	/// * All oracle handles in `oracle_relations` must be valid handles returned by
	///   `send_oracle()`.
	/// * Each `message` must match the buffer previously committed via `send_oracle()`.
