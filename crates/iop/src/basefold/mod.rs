//! Verifier for the BaseFold sumcheck-PIOP to IP compiler.
//!
//! [BaseFold] is a generalized polynomial commitment scheme that allows compilation of
//! sumcheck-PIOP protocols to IOPs. The protocol is an interactive argument for sumcheck claims
//! of multivariate polynomials defined as the product of a committed multilinear polynomial and a
//! transparent multilinear polynomial. When the transparent polynomial is a multilinear equality
//! indicator, this BaseFold instance becomes a multilinear polynomial commitment scheme. The core
//! idea is to commit the multilinear polynomial using FRI and open the sumcheck claim using an
//! interleaved instance of sumcheck on the composite polynomial and FRI on the committed codeword,
//! sharing folding challenges.
//!
//! This module implements the version specialized for binary field FRI described in [DP24],
//! Section 4. Moreover, this module includes the classic [BCS16] compiler for IOPs to IPs that
//! commits and opens oracle messages using Merkle trees.
